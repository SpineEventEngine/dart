 ### New client API.

 This release introduces the new client API. The user's interaction starts with the `Clients` class,
 which aggregates all the environment settings and allows the API user to create `Client`s on behalf
 of the actors in the system.

 The old client API is deleted. Classes like `BackendClient` and `ActorRequestFactory` are no longer
 accessible.

 It is expected that, after a testing stage, this API will soon be finalized, and the library â€”
 promoted to "production-ready".
